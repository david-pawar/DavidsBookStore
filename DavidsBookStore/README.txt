November 5, 2023  - started Assignment-2 =============================





2209 downloaded the provided guiding ppsx

2210 first cleaned the solution and then build the solution - I am glad to see 4 succeeded messaged while doing both

2217 ran the migration, and got the same red message which is shown in ppsx, however, did  not get yellow color warning or depracated version,
     and then checked my versions of packages, and they are installed with latest version 5

2219 changed the default project and no more red lines, I chose the 'AddDefaultIdentityMigration' as the name of the migration
2223 ran update-database    command
2224 reviewed the tables in SQL server object explorer

2229 run application, and did not encounter with any error.
2241 created the Category.cs file, and edit as instructed
2245 added new migration 'AddCategoryToDb'

2249 updated ApplicationDbContext.cs
